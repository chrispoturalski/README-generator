## Description

In this project, we were tasked with creating a README generator. As we create projects, we have to create a README to allow our users to see
what the project will be about, our testing information, and how to contribute in the future. Using inquirer, we are now allowed to answer questions
and they will be saved and created directly so we won't forget any thing for our future projects when creating a README. It is already laid out and 
easy to use.
